# How to modify

Just like any script thats open source you can mod these scripts to your hearts content.
Whats unique about this mod is the sheer number of core game scripts that it modifies.
Modifying these is no different than modifying any other script, however modifying these scripts allow you to modify core game mechanics if you so choose.
Each script's functions that have been modified by us for the mod are indicated as such so you can tell what functions are custom to the mod and which oens are modified by the mod.
Simply search "custom function" for custom functions and "modified function" for modified functions.
